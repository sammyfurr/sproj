\section{Introduction}

Debugging is invaluable in writing and understanding code, yet it is
rarely formally taught.  We typically teach students programming
structures, concepts, and languages, but we leave them to learn the
tools they use to code by themselves.  This approach often works
well---the programmer's choice of editor is \textit{very} personal,
students figure out how to configure an individualized workflow.
Perhaps because debuggers are tools, they often get lumped into the
``teach yourself'' category.  Unlike editors or reference guides
however, effectively using a debugger requires a set of high-level,
platform agnostic, teachable skills.  Teaching these skills is
effective, and translates into better, faster, debugging and
programming.\cite{10.1145/3286960.3286970}\cite{10.1145/3361721.3361724}\par
