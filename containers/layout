Containers:

  debug:
    - rr
    - program files
    - rr translation software
      - translates rr output -> json with pygdbmi
      - translates input from client -> rr with pygdbmi
    - client gets temp authentication token, revalidated every n seconds with database
    - created on demand for each debug session
    - can be saved

  database:
    - mongodb
    - stores which user accounts correspond to which containers
      - accounts are authenticated with github (login with github), I'm not doing auth stuff
    - stores saved containers using GridFS and the block storage volume

  orchestration:
    - manages client<->debug container connections, providing authentication and temporary auth tokens
    - creates debug containers
    - loads debug containers in and out of storage as necessary

  web server:
    - nginx
    - nodejs
    - serves base pages to clients, and transfers auth/debug container requests to orchestration server



Storage:

  block storage volume:
    - Stores saved debug sessions



Client:

  webapp:
    - ace for code display [& editing] on mobile
    - monaco for code displa [& editing] on desktop
    - this is the shit that really gives me a headache, we'll have to figure out more later
